Created by Antoine Florian and Michael Zalypko.

This K9 Sports website was built for a dog training program. It contained information on when events were occuring and classes they were offering. It also contains general information about the dog training company.

This website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My favorite part was bringing in some JavaScript to make the fixed nav go from transparent to solid once a user scrolled beyond the hero image. This website was made for a client during WEB 3400, Web Design 2.
