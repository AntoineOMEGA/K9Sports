            <h1>Rally Class</h1>
            <p>Rally training is available absolutely to everyone. To participate in the initial level, it is enough to have good contact with the dog, teach it to the team "Heel" and a few more very simple commands.</p>
            <p>In fact, this sport is more like fun starts and a kind of party. It is fun, perky, interesting.</p>
            <p>A rally is a track that you have to go along and for a while, the faster is the better. On the track, the dog must obey you.</p>
            <p>On the route that you go from start to finish, there are tasks. You walk with a dog from one station to another at a command "Heel" and perform various exercises. Your task is for the dog to go with you and not be distracted. To do this, at the very first level, you can treat the dog with a treat throughout the route.</p>
            <p>Developing skills for your dog to come through rally training are important. It promotes the physical development of the dog, disciplines its behavior and teaches the dog to overcome various obstacles.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Start with the easiest exercises</li>
                <li>Do not give commands immediately after feeding your dog</li>
                <li>Complete the exercises gradually, taking into account the physical condition of the dog</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Try to diversify your workouts so that the pet does not get bored and does not lose interest.

It is better to praise the pet as often as possible when it does something right. Then the dogâ€™s training will be associated with fun and joy and pet will be happy to do whatever you say.</p>
