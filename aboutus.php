            <h1>What we do...</h1>
            <p>We want to help both dogs and their owners learn to accept on another in their lives. We offer obedience classes that allow us to help you train your dogs to behave for you. In addition we also offer classes to increase their agility and ability to understand more advanced commands and directions.</p>

            <p>A training school for dogs will help you find a common language with your pet, teach him to obey your commands unquestioningly, not take goodies from strangers, and protect the territory. In general, we try to find a common language even with problem dogs and offer an individual approach to each dog.</p>
            <p>Training requires a remarkable endurance from the dog owner and the ability to establish contact with his pet. Unfortunately, not every dog breeder has the patience to devote so much time to a dog. That is why for many training is the only way to gain control of their four-legged friend.</p>
            <p> The dog training school at the initial training course is designed for puppies from three months. It includes teaching the dog the simplest commands and general obedience. However, it should be noted that without initial training skills, it is quite difficult to train a dog for anything else. Therefore, if the dog does not have these skills, such training must be completed. This is about training a puppy.</p>
            <p>But for older dogs, a general training course is suitable. It provides the basics of obedience for a dog and teaches simple commands. Dogs of any breed should take this course as a basis for further training. After completing the selected program, you will see how the dog has changed. However, it is important to understand that in many cases only a professional dog trainer can help the owner properly educate his dog.</p>
            <p>Our training program offers favorable conditions for cooperation for dog breeders with pets of any breed. An individual approach to each dog, individual training on open training sites - all these are the services of our professional dog handlers. We guarantee excellent obedience skills for dogs of all breeds and ages.</p>
