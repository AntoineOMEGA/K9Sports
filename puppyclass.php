            <h1>Puppy Class</h1>
            <p>A puppy training course helps to develop puppy skills and relationship of any owner with his pet. Training a puppy is essentially no different from training a dog, but training a puppy at the right age will help to avoid many problems in the future. Training a puppy eliminates the possibility of acquiring bad habits. Train your puppy only with a professional dog handler, as your pet will carry this early experience through its life.</p>
            <p>In the process of education and training of puppy, several tasks are solved:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Development of the dog’s abilities and the formation of its character</li>
                <li>Dog’s obedience to the owner and family members</li>
                <li>Training the dog to follow the owner’s commands</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When a dog does not respect the owner, dog’s behaviour becomes more independent with age. Constant playing with her in the learning process might not affect its obedience. Some dogs begin to establish their own rules in the house where they live. In this case, training is an opportunity to build the right relationship with such a dog. Educational training of puppies will help you to effectively train an adult dog in the future. Any problems are easier to see and solve in time at the very beginning, directing the development of the puppy in the right direction.</p>
            <p>At the age of about 3 to 12 weeks, the puppy develops playful behavior. If you skip this period, playing a dog will be much more difficult, and dog will prefer to execute commands for a treat, toys will not create interest for a dog.</p>
            <p>Training is a way to diversify a puppy's life and therefore it is better to socialize it. When practicing with a dog, you will feel what exactly your puppy is afraid of and what else he needs to be introduced to. And during classes dog will constantly cope with new tasks.</p>
