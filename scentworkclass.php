            <h1>Scent Work Class</h1>
            <p>The scent of a dog is forty times more sensitive than a human. The dog is capable of distinguishing different odors, including humans and animals, over long distances and recognizing human footprints even a few hours after someone has left that place. But not all dogs smell the same. To adjust your dog for scent work, it will take some time and patience.</p>
            <p>It is not difficult to teach a dog to search for objects by smell if your pet knows how to react on commands or be engaged in a game that uses objects. For example, if a dog brings you a toy, offering to throw it again, then this is the right game for our purpose.</p>
            <h4>How are dogs trained for the scent work?</h4>
            <p>During the training, dogs are trained to recognize different odors. First,  the dog's favorite food can be placed ten yards away from it, then fifteen yards and so on, until the dog starts to smell at a distance of 30 yards. Giving the dog a sniff of something, and then offering to find this thing among other things. Then the dog can be taught to look for a person.</p>
            <p>The dog will not be able to smell if it feels sick. Usually, its health is checked by touching her nose. If the nose is wet then the dog is healthy, and if it is dry then training is not carried out. Some dogs smell their upper sense above the surface, while others smell their lower sense on the ground.</p>
            <p>Scent work brings many different games and fun exercises for each dog and its owner. Based on the natural abilities of the dogâ€™s nose and its instincts, working with the nose allows the dog to become more self-confident, learn how to concentrate better and just have fun. This type of training does not require professional skills as detection dogs have. Nose work helps the dog recover from stress, helps the normal functioning of the brain and its development.</p>
